# ChatMania :rocket:

**ChatMania** is a realtime chat app that allows you to chat with your friends in pairs as well as in groups!


<br>

## About :dart:
**ChatMania** lets you create an account on the server! Once successful, you can click on the + button in chat panel, search for your friends and start chatting with them!

## Project Stack :bulb:
The project at its core is built on MERN Stack which stands for (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS)
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - ReactJS is a javascript library created by Facebook. This library lets you create beautiful web pages in couple of minutes!
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) - NodeJS is something that allows you to write javascript code on a server! Traditionally, javascript was only available for frontend design purpose however, with NodeJS, you can use javascript for backend purpose too!
* [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) - ExpressJS is a framework that drastically reduces the amount of backend code we write in NodeJS. It is highly flexible and makes things a lot easier!
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - MongoDB is a NoSQL Database that unlike SQL, stores data in form of collections!

## Project Features :fire:
* A user can create and login to his or her account
* A user can search for his friends
* A user can send them message in realtime
* A user can create group chat with unlimited number of users
* A user can edit group name and remove others from group

<br>

**ChatMania** offers realtime communication! This is achieved using the power of *socket.io* which is a popular library

<br><br>
**ChatMania** lets you create one to one chats as well as group chats! All you need to do is to create on Group Chat tab in the create chat dialog box then type the group name and add the group members using their usernme or email, and then you are good to go!

## Supporting Libraries / Frameworks / Packages used &nbsp; ðŸ› 
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) - Socket.io is a library that in simple words allows you to send and recieve data from server without having need to refresh the page, using the concept of WebSockets!
* [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/) - MaterialUI is a ReactJS library developed by google that lets you create beautiful UI elements in a quick go!
* [React Router DOM](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - React Router DOM is a NPM package that easily lets you tell the app about which web page or screen component to render depending upon a particular URL
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - Mongoose is a library that enables you to easily implement MongoDB in your code
* [Lottie React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-react) - Lottie React is an npm package that lets you render Lottie JSON animations on the web page
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Axios is an NPM package that lets you easily send HTTP requests to a particular URL
* [JsonWebToken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) - It is a package that lets you make use of JWT authentication in your app
* [BCryptJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) - This is an NPM package that lets you encrypt the passwords before you store them on the server
* [DotENV](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - This NPM package lets you securely create environment variables in .env file

## Project Setup :pencil:
If you want to clone this project and customize it further, you need to do a couple of tasks first:
* Create an account on [Mongo DB Cloud](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) if you don't have any hosting to create the database. Or install MongoDB on your hosting in case you have one
* Create an account on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). It is the place where we will store the profile pictures of all the users.
* Clone this project. You can directly download the source code, or you can use the CLI in terminal
* Once successful, open your terminal in the project folder and write npm install
* Then, go to the frontend directory by typing cd frontend and then again, write npm install
* After this, in the root folder of the project, create a new file with the exact name of ".env"
* In the .env file, write:<br><br>

```
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://YOUR_MONGO_CLOUD_USERNAME:YOUR_MONGO_CLOUD_PASSWORD@cluster0.p5xoz.mongodb.net/Cluster0?retryWrites=true&w=majority
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_CODE=abc123xyz987
```

* In signupFunctions.js, inside const configureProfilePicture function, change fetch() url to https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/YOUR_CLOUDINARY_ACCOUNT_USERNAME/image/upload and ensure you have enabled unsigned uploads on your cloudinary console
* In endpoints.js in frontend folder, change BASE_URL to localhost:5000/
* In server.js in backend folder, set const io cors origin url to localhost:5000/
* Save the file and then in frontend and backend terminal, write npm start and enjoy the project :)
<br>

#### Production Build :computer:
* To build the project for production purpose, In .env file, set NODE_ENV to production
* In terminal, open the frontend folder and write npm run build
* Once the build is completed, move back to root directory of folder by writing cd .. and then start the server again to test the code in production mode

## Project Purpose :checkered_flag:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a person can
* Implement user authentication and authorization in a NodeJS app using [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and Bearer Token
* Implement [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) in the app using [socket.io](https://socket.io/)
* Implement [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/), [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) and [CSS Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_r_mediaqueries.asp) to create beautiful UI Components
* Implement [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) in the app to store user accounts and their corresponding chats and messages
* Implement Backend [Routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing#:~:text=Routing%20is%20the%20process%20of,networks%2C%20such%20as%20the%20Internet.) using routes, middlewares and controllers with NodeJS
* Implement Frontend Routing using [React Router DOM](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
* Create a [Restful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) in NodeJS
* Perform [CRUD operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) on data in MongoDB
* Store media data like user profile pictures on a cloud storage like [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
